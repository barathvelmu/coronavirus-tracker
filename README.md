# COVID-19 Cases Tracker ðŸ“‰
## Introduction
Welcome to my COVID-19 Cases Tracker repository! If you need up to date information on the cases around the world, then you're at the right place! 

This application was built using Java, Spring, HTML/Thymeleaf, and a GitHub data repository by Johns Hopkins University. It was an amazing learning experience working on this Tracker and I can't wait to build more Spring applications in the future!

## What is the goal of this project?
With COVID-19's recent boom, there were thousands of articles, news reports, and videos covering cases around the world. I quickly felt overwhelmed by the amount of information being released daily. To make things simpler for my family and I, this one-stop web-application was developed. One can in a matter of minutes note how the virus is progressing all across the world. Big thanks to the John Hopkins University GitHub repository maintainers!

## How many awards did this project win? 
Haha I wish!
