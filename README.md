# COVID-19 Cases Tracker
## Hi there! Welcome! 
Welcome to my COVID-19 Cases Tracker repository! If you need up to date information on the cases around the world, then you're at the right place! 

## What is this project? 
This is a simple COVID-19 Cases Tracker project that I created with Java, Spring, HTML, Thymeleaf, and an open GitHub data repository from Johns Hopkins University. It was a really good learning experience doing this and I am looking forward to building more Java-based applications in the future!

## What is the goal of this project?
With COVID-19 booming around the world, there were dozens of articles, news reports, and in general media reporting cases around the world. Personally, I felt overwhelmed with the amount of information that was being released. So to make things simpler for me and my family members, I developed a one-stop application to quickly know how the virus has been spreading around the world. Big thanks to the GitHub repository by John Hopkins University!

## What are your next steps?
If so, my main objective will be to deploy this project using a cloud computing service like Azure or AWS so people around the world can easily access and look to see the effect of the virus (where it has been spreading). 

## How many awards did this project win? 
Haha I wish!
