## Hi there! Welcome! 
Welcome to my COVID-19 Patients Tracker repository! If you need up to date information on the cases around the world, then you're at the right place! 

## What is this project? 
This is a simple COVID-19 Patient Tracker project that I created with Java, Spring, HTML, Thymeleaf, and an open GitHub data repository from Johns Hopkins University. I wanted to learn Spring and how an API works to make development easy. It was a really good learning experience doing this and I am looking forward to building more Java-based applications in the future!

## What is the goal of this project?
With COVID-19 booming around the world, there are dozens of articles, news reports, and in general media reporting cases around the world. For me personally I felt overwhelmed with the amount of inforamtion that was being released. So to make things simpler for me and my family members, I developed a one-stop application to quickly know how the virus has been spreading around the world. Big thanks to the GitHub repository by John Hopkins University!

## What are your next steps?
My main objective is to deploy this project using a cloud computing service like Azure or AWS so people around the world can easily look to see how the virus has been spreading. 

## How many awards did this project win? 
Haha I wish!
